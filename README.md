# Fake-News-Classifier_NLP
To Classify Fake News
In these notebooks, I have focused on fake news classification using various machine learning and deep learning approaches. The train dataset from Kaggle was utilized, and the methods applied can similarly be used for the test dataset.

In the Fake News Classifier notebook, I employed the Bag of Words technique with the Multinomial Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB) and Passive Aggressive Classifier algorithms, using the 'title' as the primary feature.

In the Fake News Classifier 2 notebook, I utilized Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) along with the MultinomialNB and Passive Aggressive Classifier, using 'text' as the feature set.

In the Fake News Classifier LSTM notebook, I implemented word embeddings with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model consisting of 100 neurons. The model was optimized with a dropout rate of 0.3, using the 'title' as the feature set.
