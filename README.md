# Fake-News-Classifier_NLP
To Classify Fake News
In these notebooks, I have focused on fake news classification using various machine learning and deep learning approaches. The train dataset from Kaggle was utilized, and the methods applied can similarly be used for the test dataset.

In the Fake News Classifier notebook, I employed the Bag of Words technique with the Multinomial Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB) and Passive Aggressive Classifier algorithms, using the 'title' as the primary feature.
